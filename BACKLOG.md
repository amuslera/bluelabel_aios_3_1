# AIOSv3 Backlog - Future Improvements & Ideas

## üéØ Priority Items

### Hermes Concierge Training & Improvements
**Added**: June 3, 2025  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Sprint Target**: 3.4 or 3.5

#### Issues Identified:
1. **No LLM Integration**: Currently using only fallback responses!
   - SimpleHermesAgent has only 3 canned responses
   - No actual conversation understanding
   - Repeats same response regardless of user input
   - **CRITICAL**: Need to enable real LLM integration ASAP

2. **Poor Intent Recognition**: Confusing AUTOMATE intent with BUILD intent
   - User asked about automating article extraction ‚Üí Hermes thinks they want to build something
   - Should recognize this as workflow automation, not app building

3. **Generic Responses**: Not tailoring responses to specific use cases
   - "Read later" article digest is a clear automation workflow
   - Should ask about: source (browser extension? email? RSS?), frequency, format preferences

4. **Non-Technical User Support**: Responses assume technical knowledge
   - Asking "website, app, or API?" to non-technical users is confusing
   - Should use plain language: "Would this be something you access in your browser, on your phone, or automated in the background?"

#### Proposed Improvements:
- [ ] Enhanced intent detection with more specific patterns
- [ ] Use case library for common scenarios (article digest, inventory tracking, etc.)
- [ ] Persona-specific language (avoid technical jargon for business users)
- [ ] Better clarifying questions based on detected use case
- [ ] Integration with real LLM for nuanced understanding
- [ ] Pre-built templates for common automation workflows
