## Conversation

**User**: I'm working on giving our AI agents (Apollo, Aphrodite, Athena, Hephaestus) 
full code writing capabilities. Currently they have the structure but can't actually:
- Generate working code from requirements  
- Use git for version control
- Run bash commands
- Debug issues iteratively

What would be your recommended approach to implement these capabilities? 
What should we prioritize first?

**Hermes**:  Hello there! It sounds like an exciting project you're working on, giving our AI agents (Apollo, Aphrodite, Athena, Hephaestus) the ability to write full code. Let's break this down and approach it step by step.

1. Generating working code from requirements:
   To achieve this, we need a robust understanding of the problem domain and the ability to translate high-level requirements into low-level instructions that can be executed as code. This might involve machine learning techniques for natural language processing (NLP) and programming by example (PBE). It's a complex task but essential for our agents to become truly autonomous.

2. Using git for version control:
   Version control is crucial for managing changes in the codebase, allowing us to track updates, roll back to previous versions, and collaborate more effectively. Implementing git integration will enable our agents to work on multiple branches, merge changes, and maintain a clean and organized code history.

3. Running bash commands:
   The ability to run bash commands will empower our agents to interact with the underlying system, automate tasks, and manage infrastructure more efficiently. This could involve teaching them how to interpret command-line interfaces (CLIs) and understand common Linux utilities.

4. Debugging issues iteratively:
   Debugging is a critical skill for any developer, allowing them to identify and fix errors in the code. Teaching our agents debugging techniques might involve implementing test-driven development (TDD), using logging mechanisms, and providing visual feedback on where potential issues may lie within the code.

In terms of prioritization, I would recommend focusing first on generating working code from requirements and implementing git for version control. These two capabilities are essential foundations for our agents to become truly autonomous developers. Once they can write and manage their code effectively, we can move on to enabling them to run bash commands and debug issues iteratively.

Let's take it one step at a time, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification. I'm here to help! ðŸ˜Š

**User**: Specifically for code generation, should we:
1. Use the same LLM router we have for conversations?
2. Create specialized prompts for each agent type?
3. Implement code validation before agents commit?

What are the key risks to watch for?

**Hermes**:  Hey there! I'm Hermes, your friendly concierge here to help you build something amazing with our AI team: Apollo (Backend), Aphrodite (Frontend), Athena (QA), and Hephaestus (DevOps).

I understand that you'd like to create something new, but it seems we need more information about your project. To get started, could you please tell me what kind of application or system you want to build? Who is the intended user, and what problem does this solution aim to solve for them?

Now, let's talk about code generation for a bit. It sounds like you'd like our AI agents to write code for your project. Here are some ideas on how we can approach it:

1. Use the same LLM router we have for conversations: This method would enable users to communicate with the entire team using the same conversational interface. However, it might result in more generic responses without tailoring the output for each agent type specifically.
2. Create specialized prompts for each agent type: By creating separate prompts for Apollo, Aphrodite, Athena, and Hephaestus, we can ensure that their responses are specific to their areas of expertise. This approach may lead to more focused and accurate results.
3. Implement code validation before agents commit: To maintain the quality of our generated code, it's essential to incorporate a validation step before the agents commit their changes. This process will help catch any potential issues and ensure the code is functional and follows best practices.

When implementing these features, there are some key risks to watch out for:

1. Misunderstanding user requirements: To avoid this, it's crucial to gather comprehensive information about the project upfront and continuously validate our understanding throughout the development process.
2. Generating poor-quality code: Implementing a robust validation step and continuous quality assurance will help mitigate this risk.
3. Ensuring agent coordination: As the agents work on different aspects of the project, it's essential to maintain clear communication and collaboration between them to ensure consistent results.

I hope these insights are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on our approach. We're here to help make your idea a reality. ðŸ˜Š
