# Monitoring System Development Project

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a real-time monitoring dashboard for AIOSv3 agents using our own AI development team.

## 👥 Team Structure
- **Technical Lead**: Claude (me) - Code review, architecture decisions, quality control
- **CTO Agent**: System design and architecture
- **Backend Dev**: Logging infrastructure and data streaming
- **Frontend Dev**: Terminal UI dashboard
- **QA Engineer**: Testing and quality assurance

## 🔒 Development Process

### Git Workflow
1. **Protected main branch** - No direct commits
2. **Feature branches** - Each agent works on their own branch
3. **Pull Request required** - All changes reviewed by Technical Lead
4. **Strict review process** - Code quality, tests, documentation

### Branch Structure
```
main (protected)
├── feature/cto-monitoring-architecture
├── feature/backend-logging-system
├── feature/frontend-terminal-ui
└── feature/qa-test-suite
```

### Code Review Criteria
- ✅ Code runs without errors
- ✅ Follows Python PEP8 standards
- ✅ Includes unit tests
- ✅ Has proper documentation
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Performance is acceptable

## 📋 Sprint Tasks

### Task 1: Architecture Design (CTO Agent)
- Design monitoring system architecture
- Define message formats and protocols
- Create system diagrams
- Document API contracts
- **Branch**: `feature/cto-monitoring-architecture`
- **Deliverables**: `docs/monitoring_architecture.md`, `docs/api_spec.md`

### Task 2: Logging System (Backend Dev)
- Implement agent activity logging
- Create message queue for real-time updates
- Build data persistence layer
- Develop streaming API
- **Branch**: `feature/backend-logging-system`
- **Deliverables**: `src/logging/`, `src/streaming/`, `tests/test_logging.py`

### Task 3: Terminal Dashboard (Frontend Dev)
- Build terminal UI using Rich/Blessed
- Implement real-time data display
- Add interactive commands
- Create detail views
- **Branch**: `feature/frontend-terminal-ui`
- **Deliverables**: `src/dashboard/`, `tests/test_dashboard.py`

### Task 4: Test Suite (QA Engineer)
- Write comprehensive tests
- Create test data generators
- Build integration tests
- Performance testing
- **Branch**: `feature/qa-test-suite`
- **Deliverables**: `tests/integration/`, `tests/performance/`

## 🎯 Success Criteria
1. Dashboard shows real-time agent activity
2. Less than 1 second latency
3. Handles 100+ events/second
4. Zero crashes in 1 hour of operation
5. All code reviewed and approved

## ⚠️ Junior Developer Constraints
- Simple, clear code over clever solutions
- Extensive comments required
- Must ask for help when stuck
- No external dependencies without approval
- Test everything, assume nothing

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We'll assess each agent on:
1. Code quality (readability, structure)
2. Task completion (did it work?)
3. Problem-solving approach
4. Communication clarity
5. Error handling
6. Testing thoroughness
