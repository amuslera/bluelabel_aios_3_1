Hi team! Alex here, your Frontend Developer üé®

I've reviewed the current sprint and I'm ready to start on the 
Control Center UI. I'll be using Textual for the TUI as specified.

My plan:
1. Set up the basic layout structure
2. Create reusable components
3. Implement real-time updates
4. Add keyboard navigation

I'll keep everyone updated on progress. Looking forward to 
creating an amazing user experience!

@marcus-backend - I'll need the WebSocket endpoint details when 
you have them.
