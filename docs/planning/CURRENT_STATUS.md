# AIOSv3 Current Status

**Last Updated**: June 1, 2025

## 🎯 Project Vision
Building a platform where businesses can hire AI development teams at 10% the cost of human teams, with full transparency and human collaboration.

## 📊 Current Sprint Status

### ✅ Completed Sprints
1. **Sprint 1.2**: Enhanced BaseAgent Framework (Complete)
2. **Sprint 1.3**: Multi-Agent Collaboration (Complete with issues)
3. **Sprint 1.4**: Visibility Attempt (10% - only basic logger built)
4. **Sprint 1.5**: Theatrical Agent System + PR Workflow (Complete)

### 🔄 Current State
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Single agent PR workflow tested successfully
- **Clean Git State**: All work committed to main branch
- **Monitoring Server**: Basic version exists (needs auth, disk overflow)
- **Agent Framework**: Theatrical agents with human-paced operations ready

## 🏗️ What's Built

### Working Components:
1. **Theatrical Agent System**
   - Human-paced operations with visible thinking
   - Progress bars and strategic pauses
   - Adjustable speed (currently 50% of demo speed)
   - Agent personas with unique styles

2. **PR Workflow**
   - Agents work on feature branches
   - Create commits with proper messages
   - AI reviews code (I review)
   - Human approves (you decide)
   - Clean merge process

3. **Monitoring System** (Partial)
   - WebSocket server (no auth yet)
   - Activity storage (no disk overflow)
   - Basic tests (minimal coverage)
   - REST API endpoints

4. **TodoApp** (From Sprint 1.3)
   - Fully functional REST API
   - Clean architecture
   - Works but built by old agent system

## 📋 Immediate Backlog

### High Priority:
1. **Improve Pacing** - Make agents 70% faster with better engagement
2. **Build Control Center** - Unified UI for managing agents
3. **Add Intelligence** - Agent questions, learning, error recovery
4. **Complete Monitoring** - Add auth, disk overflow, better tests

### Medium Priority:
1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - Test 2+ agents with dependencies
2. **Memory System** - Persistent agent memory
3. **Enhanced Testing** - Better test coverage requirements

## 🚀 Next Sprint Options

### Option A: Control Center (Recommended)
- Frontend agent builds unified TUI
- Integrates with monitoring server
- Includes PR review interface
- Better UX for you

### Option B: Pacing + Intelligence
- Speed up agents 70%
- Add progress bars at key moments
- Enable agent questions
- Better error recovery

### Option C: Complete Monitoring
- Add authentication
- Implement disk overflow
- Expand test coverage
- Production-ready server

## 🔑 Key Learnings
1. Agents behave like junior developers
2. PR workflow enables quality control
3. Theatrical pacing provides needed visibility
4. Explicit instructions are crucial
5. Speed vs comprehension tradeoff exists

## 📊 Metrics
- **Agent Success Rate**: 80% (completes task but misses some requirements)
- **Code Quality**: 7/10 (functional but incomplete)
- **Process Compliance**: 10/10 (perfect git workflow)
- **Time Efficiency**: Good (15 min for monitoring server)

## 🎯 Strategic Alignment
Following "Foundation First" principle:
- ✅ Basic agent capabilities proven
- ✅ Visibility greatly improved
- ⚠️ Error recovery needs work
- ❌ No memory/learning yet
- ❌ Limited agent intelligence

## 🔮 Path to Production
1. **Now**: Improve UX and agent intelligence
2. **Next**: Multi-agent orchestration
3. **Then**: Memory and learning systems
4. **Later**: Commercial features (billing, multi-tenancy)
5. **Finally**: Public launch

## 💡 Ready for Next Sprint
All code committed, documentation complete, ready to proceed with chosen direction.
