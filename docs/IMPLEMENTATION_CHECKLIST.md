# Implementation Checklist - Development Process v3.1

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Actions

### Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Create PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (merge all vision/status docs)
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.md (merge all technical docs)
- [ ] Create AGENT_ROSTER.md (define all agents)
- [ ] Create ORCHESTRATION_DESIGN.md (how agents work together)
- [ ] Archive all duplicate documents

### Phase 2: Templates & Standards (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Create /templates/ directory
- [ ] Write SPRINT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Write TASK_ASSIGNMENT_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Write SPRINT_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Write PR_TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Create /standards/ directory with coding standards

### Phase 3: Agent Onboarding (Day 5)
- [ ] Create /agents/onboarding/ directory
- [ ] Write CTO_AGENT_ONBOARD.md
- [ ] Write FRONTEND_AGENT_ONBOARD.md
- [ ] Write BACKEND_AGENT_ONBOARD.md
- [ ] Write QA_AGENT_ONBOARD.md
- [ ] Write DEVOPS_AGENT_ONBOARD.md

### Phase 4: Process Automation (Day 6-7)
- [ ] Create start_sprint.py script
- [ ] Create sprint_status.py dashboard
- [ ] Set up automated quality checks
- [ ] Configure git hooks for standards
- [ ] Test full sprint cycle

### Phase 5: Pilot Sprint (Day 8-10)
- [ ] Run pilot sprint with new process
- [ ] Gather metrics and feedback
- [ ] Refine based on results
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Prepare for full rollout

## ðŸ“‹ Key Deliverables

1. **Single Source of Truth Docs**
   - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (what & why)
   - ARCHITECTURE.md (how technically)
   - DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md (how we work)
   - AGENT_ROSTER.md (who does what)

2. **Operational Templates**
   - All sprint ceremony templates
   - Task assignment format
   - Review checklists
   - Communication templates

3. **Agent Enablement**
   - Self-contained onboarding docs
   - Clear role definitions
   - Communication protocols
   - Quality standards

4. **Automation Tools**
   - Sprint setup script
   - Progress dashboard
   - Quality gates
   - Metric collectors

## âœ… Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero duplicate information
- [ ] New agent onboards in <5 minutes
- [ ] Sprint setup in <10 minutes
- [ ] All processes have templates
- [ ] Metrics dashboard operational
- [ ] First pilot sprint successful

## ðŸŽ¯ End Goal

A fully autonomous development team where:
- Agents self-organize around tasks
- Quality is built-in, not inspected-in  
- Progress is transparent in real-time
- Human intervention is exception, not rule
- Learning improves each sprint
