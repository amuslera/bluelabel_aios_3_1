### 3. Seamless Project Kickoff
- **Auto-provisioning**: GitHub repo, CI/CD, staging environment
- **Smart defaults**: Best practices for chosen stack
- **Documentation**: README, CONTRIBUTING, architecture docs
- **Communication**: Slack workspace with all agents

### 4. Collaborative Development

#### Slack Integration Example:
```
#general channel:

@sarah-cto: Team, we're starting Sprint 1! Focus on user authentication.
@marcus-mobile: I'll design the login screens. Sharing Figma link shortly.
@elena-backend: Setting up JWT auth endpoints now.

#standup channel (automated daily):

@sarah-cto: Daily Standup - Sprint 1, Day 3
@marcus-mobile: ✅ Completed login UI, 🔄 Working on signup flow
@elena-backend: ✅ Auth endpoints done, 🔄 Adding OAuth providers
@raj-qa: 🔄 Writing auth test suite, found 2 edge cases

You: @sarah-cto can we add fingerprint login?
@sarah-cto: Great idea! I'll add it to the backlog. @marcus-mobile can handle this in Sprint 2.
```
