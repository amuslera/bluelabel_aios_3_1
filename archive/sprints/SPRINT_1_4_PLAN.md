# Sprint 1.4: Real-Time Agent Visibility

**Sprint Goal**: See everything agents are doing in real-time
**Duration**: 1 day (4-6 hours)
**Success Metric**: 100% of agent actions are visible and understandable

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

Based on Sprint 1.3 lessons:
1. Implement comprehensive agent activity logging
2. Build real-time monitoring dashboard
3. Add progress indicators for long operations
4. Show git operations and file changes
5. Display decision-making rationale

## 📋 User Stories

### Story 1: Activity Streaming (3 points)
**As a** Technical Lead  
**I want** to see what each agent is doing in real-time  
**So that** I can identify issues immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Every agent action is logged with timestamp
- [ ] File operations show path and operation type
- [ ] Git commands show full command and result
- [ ] Decision points show reasoning
- [ ] Errors are highlighted prominently

### Story 2: Monitoring Dashboard (5 points)
**As a** Technical Lead  
**I want** a single dashboard showing all agents  
**So that** I can monitor the entire team at once

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Shows all active agents and their status
- [ ] Displays current task and progress
- [ ] Shows recent activity feed
- [ ] Updates in real-time (<1s delay)
- [ ] Indicates blocked or failed agents

### Story 3: Progress Tracking (2 points)
**As a** Technical Lead  
**I want** to see progress on long operations  
**So that** I know agents aren't stuck

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Progress bars for multi-step tasks
- [ ] Time elapsed and estimated remaining
- [ ] Current step description
- [ ] Completion percentage

## 🏗️ Technical Approach

### 1. Enhanced Agent Base Class
```python
class VisibleAgent(MonitoringDevelopmentAgent):
    """Agent with comprehensive activity logging."""
    
    async def log_activity(self, activity_type: str, details: dict):
        """Log all activities to monitoring system."""
        # Send to dashboard
        # Write to activity log
        # Update progress if applicable
    
    async def run_command(self, cmd: list, description: str):
        """Run command with full visibility."""
        await self.log_activity("command_start", {
            "command": " ".join(cmd),
            "description": description
        })
        # Run command
        # Log output and result
```

### 2. Real-Time Dashboard Architecture
```
Agent Process → Activity Logger → Message Queue → Dashboard Terminal
                                         ↓
                                    Activity File (backup)
```

### 3. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Agent Enhancement (2 hours)
1. Create VisibleAgent base class
2. Add activity logging to all operations
3. Implement progress tracking
4. Add decision logging

#### Phase 2: Dashboard Creation (2 hours)
1. Build terminal UI with Rich
2. Implement WebSocket server
3. Create activity feed
4. Add agent status panels

#### Phase 3: Integration (1 hour)
1. Connect agents to dashboard
2. Test real-time updates
3. Add error highlighting
4. Verify all activities visible

#### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (1 hour)
1. Test with multiple agents
2. Verify <1s update latency
3. Test error scenarios
4. Polish UI appearance

## 📊 Definition of Done

- [ ] All agent activities are logged
- [ ] Dashboard shows real-time updates
- [ ] No silent failures
- [ ] Progress visible for all operations
- [ ] Errors prominently displayed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Retrospective completed

## 🚀 Launch Plan

1. **Use our AI agents to build this!**
   - But with better instructions based on lessons learned
   - Include git workflow in task descriptions
   - Add validation steps

2. **Incremental Rollout**
   - Start with activity logging
   - Add dashboard next
   - Test with single agent
   - Scale to full team

3. **Continuous Validation**
   - Check logs are actually generated
   - Verify dashboard receives updates
   - Ensure no performance impact

## 🎯 Success Metrics

1. **Visibility Coverage**: 100% of operations logged
2. **Update Latency**: <1 second
3. **Error Detection**: 100% of errors shown
4. **Human Interventions**: 50% reduction
5. **Agent Success Rate**: 90%+

## 📝 Notes from Previous Sprint

**Must Remember:**
- Agents need explicit git commit instructions
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Human terminal interface is critical
- Test the full workflow, not just parts
- Make failures visible immediately

**Key Innovation:**
- Use the monitoring system to monitor its own development
- Dogfood from the very beginning
- See agents building the visibility system in real-time
