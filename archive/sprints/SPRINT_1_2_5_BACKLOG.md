## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- BaseAgent initialization and lifecycle
- Configuration validation
- Component integration points
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Full agent lifecycle with all components
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Memory persistence across restarts
- LLM routing decisions
- Health monitoring and recovery

### Example Test Scenarios
1. Agent starts, processes task, stores memory, shuts down cleanly
2. Agent fails, triggers recovery, resumes from checkpoint
3. Two agents communicate via message queue
4. Agent switches between LLMs based on task type
5. Agent compresses context when hitting limits

## 📝 Definition of Done

## 📋 Example Usage

```python
# Creating a specialized agent
class CTOAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig):
        super().__init__(
            agent_type=AgentType.CTO,
            config=config
        )
    
    async def process_task(self, task: AgentTask) -> TaskResult:
        # Use LLM routing for decision
        response = await self.llm_generate(
            task.prompt,
            routing_context=RoutingContext(
                task_type=TaskType.ARCHITECTURE_DECISION,
                complexity=8,
                privacy_sensitive=task.private
            )
        )
        
        # Store decision in memory
        await self.store_knowledge(
