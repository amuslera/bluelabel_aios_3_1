## ðŸ‘¥ Agent Assignments

### Frontend Agent (Alex Rivera)
- **Primary**: CC-001, CC-002, CC-003, CC-004, CC-005
- **Support**: UI for AI-002 (question interface)

### Backend Agent (Marcus Chen)
- **Primary**: MON-001, MON-002
- **Support**: AI-001, AI-003 (backend logic)

### QA Agent (Sam Martinez)
- **Primary**: Test coverage for all components
- **Focus**: Integration tests, error scenarios

### DevOps Agent (Jordan Kim)
- **Primary**: CI/CD updates, deployment configs
- **Focus**: Monitoring infrastructure

## ðŸš€ Execution Plan

### Week 1
- Day 1-2: Project setup and MON-001 (complete monitoring server)
- Day 3-4: CC-001 and CC-002 (basic UI structure)
- Day 5: CC-003 (activity monitor integration)

### Week 2
- Day 6-7: CC-004 and CC-005 (task and PR panels)
- Day 8-9: AI-001 and AI-002 (error recovery and questions)
- Day 10: AI-003 and final integration

## ðŸ“Š Risk Management

1. **UI Complexity**: Start with basic functionality, iterate
2. **Integration Issues**: Test each component in isolation first
3. **Agent Coordination**: Use synchronous development sessions
4. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize as we go

## ðŸ”„ Daily Practices

1. **Morning Check-in**: Review agent progress
2. **Midday Sync**: Address blockers
3. **Evening Review**: Commit and document progress
4. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests after each commit

## ðŸ“ˆ Metrics to Track

- Lines of code per component
- Test coverage percentage
- Agent success rate
- Error recovery rate
- Task completion time
- Human intervention frequency

## ðŸŽ¯ Definition of Done

- Code reviewed and approved
- Tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- Documentation updated
- Integrated with existing systems
- Deployed to development environment
- Acceptance criteria met
