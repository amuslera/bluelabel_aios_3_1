# Phase 1: Single Agent PR Workflow - READY TO RUN

## 🎯 What I've Built

### 1. Single Agent Test (`single_agent_pr_test.py`)
- Backend agent (Marcus) implements monitoring server
- Works on feature branch
- Creates local "PR" when done
- Theatrical mode at 50% faster speed

### 2. Review Terminal (`review_pr.py`)
- I review the code and provide analysis
- You see my review and make decision
- Options: Approve, Request Changes, View Code, Run Tests
- Executes merge or feedback

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Run the Agent
```bash
./single_agent_pr_test.py
```

Watch as the agent:
- Creates feature branch
- Thinks through architecture
- Writes monitoring server code
- Commits and creates PR

### Step 2: Review the PR
```bash
./review_pr.py
```

You'll see:
- PR summary
- Git diff
- My code review (strengths, concerns, suggestions)
- Your decision options

## 📋 What the Agent Will Build

1. **monitoring_server.py**
   - WebSocket server on port 6795
   - Multiple client support
   - REST API endpoints
   - CORS configuration

2. **activity_store.py**
   - In-memory storage with disk overflow
   - Query capabilities
   - Agent tracking

3. **test_monitoring.py**
   - Basic test coverage
   - Health check tests
   - Storage tests

## 🔄 Recovery Points

The system is designed to be conservative:
- Git branches can be deleted/recreated
- Each phase is isolated
- Review records are saved
- Easy rollback with git

## ⚠️ Expected Issues (Prepared to Handle)

1. **Branch already exists** - Script cleans up first
2. **Import errors in tests** - Agent uses relative imports
3. **Missing dependencies** - We'll note for requirements.txt

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ Agent completes task independently
- ✅ Creates working code
- ✅ Follows git workflow
- ✅ You can review and approve
- ✅ Merge works cleanly
