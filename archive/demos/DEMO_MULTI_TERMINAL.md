# Multi-Terminal Claude Code Collaboration Demo

## üéØ Vision Achieved

We have successfully implemented the **multi-terminal Claude Code collaboration system** that allows multiple Claude Code instances to work together in real-time on the same repository. This is exactly what was envisioned - multiple terminals, each running Claude Code with different roles, collaborating as a team.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components Built

1. **Enhanced BaseAgent Framework** (`agents/base/enhanced_agent.py`)
   - Complete agent lifecycle management (8 states)
   - LLM routing with cost optimization 
   - Memory & context management with Redis
   - Health monitoring and automatic recovery
   - Task processing with comprehensive error handling

2. **CollaborativeAgent** (`agents/collaborative_agent.py`)
   - Extends Enhanced BaseAgent with collaboration capabilities
   - WebSocket connection to coordination server
   - Role-based behavior and response formatting
   - Real-time message handling and task assignment
   - Automatic response to team messages

3. **Collaboration Server** (`collaboration_server.py`)
   - WebSocket server for real-time coordination
   - Manages team state and message broadcasting
   - Task orchestration and assignment
   - File change notifications
   - Collaborator presence and status tracking

4. **Agent Launcher** (`launch_agent.py`)
   - Unified entry point for all agent roles
   - Interactive terminal interface per agent
   - Shared LLM router with Claude API integration
   - Role-specific commands and capabilities

## üöÄ How to Use the System

### Step 1: Start Collaboration Server
```bash
# Terminal 1: Coordination Server
python3 collaboration_server.py
```

### Step 2: Launch Multiple Claude Code Agents
```bash
# Terminal 2: You as Product Owner
python3 launch_agent.py --role=human --name="Product Owner"

# Terminal 3: CTO Agent
python3 launch_agent.py --role=cto --name="CTO Agent"

# Terminal 4: Backend Developer Agent  
python3 launch_agent.py --role=backend-dev --name="Backend Developer"

# Terminal 5: QA Engineer Agent
python3 launch_agent.py --role=qa --name="QA Engineer"
```

### Step 3: Collaborate in Real-Time

Each terminal provides an interactive interface:

```
üöÄ AIOSv3 COLLABORATIVE AGENT TERMINAL
================================================================================
Agent: CTO Agent (cto)
ID: cto_agent_12345
Repository: /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3
================================================================================

‚úÖ Connected to collaboration team!

üí° Commands for cto:
   chat <message>     - Send message to team
   status <status>    - Update status (active/busy/idle)
   task <description> - Create and announce new task
   team               - Show team status
   help               - Show this help
   quit               - Leave collaboration

üéØ As CTO:
   - Provide technical architecture guidance
   - Make technology decisions
   - Review technical approaches

```

## üí¨ Real Collaboration Examples

### Planning Session
```bash
# You (Product Owner)
human> chat We need to implement user authentication for our API

# CTO responds automatically (using Claude API)
üí¨ [14:32:15] CTO Agent: I recommend implementing JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens. Should we use a database-backed session store or stateless tokens?

# Backend Developer joins conversation
backend-dev> chat I can implement the JWT middleware. What's our token expiration strategy?

# QA Engineer adds input
qa> chat I'll need test cases for token validation, expiration, and refresh flows
```

### Task Coordination
```bash
# You create tasks
human> task Implement JWT authentication system
üìã Created task: Implement JWT authentication system

# CTO breaks it down
cto> task Design authentication database schema
cto> task Create JWT middleware for API routes
cto> status busy working on auth architecture

# Backend Developer takes ownership
backend-dev> chat I'll handle the middleware implementation
backend-dev> status busy implementing JWT middleware

# QA plans testing
qa> task Write comprehensive auth tests
qa> status busy creating test scenarios
```

### Real-time Status Updates
```bash
# Show team status anytime
human> team

üë• Current Team:
   üü¢ Product Owner (human)
   üü° CTO Agent (cto) - working on auth architecture  
   üü° Backend Developer (backend-dev) - implementing JWT middleware
   üü° QA Engineer (qa) - creating test scenarios
```

## üß† Agent Capabilities

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced BaseAgent Integration
Each collaborative agent inherits the full Enhanced BaseAgent framework:

```python
class CollaborativeAgent(EnhancedBaseAgent):
    async def _handle_team_message(self, data):
        # Automatically respond to relevant team messages
        if self._should_respond_to_message(content, from_role):
            response_task = EnhancedTask(
                task_type=TaskType.GENERAL,
                prompt=f"As a {self.role}, respond to: {content}",
                complexity=3
            )
            result = await self.process_task(response_task)
            await self.send_collaboration_message({
                "type": "chat",
                "content": result.output
            })
```

### LLM Routing with Cost Optimization
```python
# Shared router across all agents
router = LLMRouter(default_policy=RoutingPolicy(
    strategy=RoutingStrategy.COST_OPTIMIZED,
    max_cost_per_request=0.25
))

# Real Claude API integration
claude_provider = ClaudeProvider(ClaudeConfig(
    api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
    timeout=45.0
))
```

### Real-time WebSocket Communication
```python
# Bidirectional communication between agents
await self.send_collaboration_message({
    "type": "task_assignment",
    "task": {
        "id": task_id,
        "title": "Implement user authentication",
        "assigned_to": "backend-dev",
        "complexity": 7
    }
})
```

## üéØ What This Achieves

### For the User
1. **Multiple Specialized AI Assistants**: Instead of one general assistant, you have a whole team of specialists
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: See the team working together, discussing, and building
3. **Role-based Expertise**: Each agent brings deep knowledge in their domain
4. **Natural Team Dynamics**: Experience what it's like to have an AI development team

### For Development
1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work on different aspects simultaneously
2. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review and testing from specialized agents
3. **Knowledge Transfer**: Agents share context and learn from each other
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Architecture, implementation, testing, and documentation

### For the Vision
1. **True Multi-Terminal Collaboration**: Multiple Claude Code instances working together
2. **Shared Repository Context**: All agents working on the same codebase
3. **Real-time Coordination**: Live communication and task orchestration
4. **Role Specialization**: Each terminal has its own expertise and behavior

## üèÅ Sprint Day 1 - Complete!

### ‚úÖ Accomplished

### üéâ Result
We have achieved the core vision: **Multiple Claude Code instances collaborating in real-time within the same repository.** Each terminal runs a specialized agent that can communicate, coordinate, and work together as a cohesive development team.

The foundation is complete and ready for the remaining sprint days to add task orchestration, role specialization, workspace integration, and final polish.

## üöÄ Next Steps (Days 2-5)
