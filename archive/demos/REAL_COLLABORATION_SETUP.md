# ðŸš€ REAL Multi-Terminal Collaboration Setup

## Quick Start - See Real AI Agents Collaborating!

Follow these steps to see **actual AI agents collaborating in real-time** across multiple terminals.

### Step 1: Start the Collaboration Server

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3
python3 simple_server.py
```

You should see:
```
ðŸš€ Starting Simple Collaboration Server on port 8765...
âœ… Server running at ws://localhost:8765
ðŸ’¡ Multiple terminals can now connect!
```

### Step 2: Connect Your AI Development Team

**Terminal 2 (You - Product Owner):**
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3
python3 simple_agent.py --role=human --name="Product Owner"
```

**Terminal 3 (CTO Agent with Real Claude API):**
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3
python3 simple_agent.py --role=cto --name="CTO Agent"
```

**Terminal 4 (Backend Developer with Real Claude API):**
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3
python3 simple_agent.py --role=backend-dev --name="Backend Developer"
```

**Terminal 5 (QA Engineer with Real Claude API):**
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3
python3 simple_agent.py --role=qa --name="QA Engineer"
```

### Step 3: Start Collaborating!

In **Terminal 2** (your terminal), you'll see:
```
ðŸ’¡ Interactive mode for Product Owner
Commands:
  chat <message>  - Send message to team
  task <title>    - Create task
  quit           - Exit

human>
```

**Try these commands:**

```bash
# Send a message to your AI team
human> chat We need to implement user authentication for our API

# Create a task
human> task Implement JWT authentication system

# Ask for technical guidance
human> chat What's the best approach for secure password hashing?

# Make product decisions
human> chat Let's use JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry for security
```

### What You'll See:

**In Terminal 1 (Server):**
- Real-time log of all messages and connections
- Agent join/leave notifications
- Message exchanges between team members

**In Terminal 3 (CTO Agent):**
- Automatic responses with **real Claude API** intelligence
- Technical architecture guidance
- Strategic recommendations

**In Terminal 4 (Backend Developer):**
- Implementation suggestions and code guidance
- Technical solutions and time estimates
- Practical development advice

**In Terminal 5 (QA Engineer):**
- Testing strategies and quality recommendations
- Validation approaches and quality metrics

### Example Real Collaboration:

```bash
# You type in Terminal 2:
human> chat We need user authentication for our API

# Terminal 1 (Server) shows:
ðŸ’¬ Product Owner: We need user authentication for our API

# Terminal 3 (CTO Agent) automatically responds:
ðŸ¤– CTO Agent responding...
ðŸ’¬ [14:32:15] CTO Agent: I recommend implementing JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing using bcrypt. We should create a login endpoint that validates credentials and returns a JWT token with appropriate expiration...

# Terminal 4 (Backend Developer) might add:
ðŸ¤– Backend Developer responding...
ðŸ’¬ [14:32:25] Backend Developer: I can implement that! I'll use the jsonwebtoken library for JWT handling and bcrypt for password hashing. The implementation should take about 4-6 hours including tests...
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features You'll Experience:

### âœ… Real-time Multi-Terminal Collaboration
- **Multiple terminals** running simultaneously
- **Live message exchange** between terminals
- **Instant notifications** when agents join/leave

### âœ… Intelligent AI Responses
- **Real Claude API integration** for authentic AI responses
- **Role-specific expertise** - each agent has domain knowledge
- **Context-aware responses** based on conversation history

### âœ… Natural Team Dynamics
- **Automatic participation** - AI agents respond when relevant
- **Role-based behavior** - CTO gives architecture guidance, Backend Dev offers implementation details
- **Collaborative problem-solving** - team works together on solutions

### âœ… Task Coordination
- **Task creation** and broadcasting to team
- **Real-time progress** updates and collaboration
- **Shared context** across all team members

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:

**If agents don't respond intelligently:**
- Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
- Agents will use fallback responses if Claude API isn't available

**If connections fail:**
- Make sure Terminal 1 (server) is running first
- Check that port 8765 isn't blocked

**If you don't see messages:**
- Each terminal shows different perspectives
- Server terminal shows all activity
- Agent terminals show their view of the collaboration

## ðŸŽ‰ What This Demonstrates:

This is **exactly** the multi-terminal Claude Code collaboration you envisioned:

1. **Multiple Claude Code instances** (each terminal)
2. **Real-time collaboration** between specialized AI agents
3. **Intelligent task coordination** and team communication
4. **You as Product Owner** directing the team and making decisions
5. **Autonomous AI agents** providing expertise and executing work

**This is your AI development team in action!** ðŸš€

## ðŸš€ Ready to Scale:

Once you see this working, you can:
- Add more agent roles (Frontend Dev, DevOps, etc.)
- Integrate with the full Task Orchestrator system
- Connect to real development workflows
- Scale to larger teams and more complex projects

**The foundation for AI-powered software development teams is working!** ðŸŽŠ
