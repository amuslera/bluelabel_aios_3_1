2. Vector search implementation
3. Performance benchmarking
4. API Gateway implementation

### Low Priority
1. UI Dashboard
2. Additional monitoring
3. Advanced routing algorithms
4. Model fine-tuning

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well
- **Modular Design**: Each component works independently
- **Test-Driven Development**: Catching issues early
- **Documentation First**: Clear understanding before coding
- **Incremental Delivery**: Steady progress with working software

### Areas for Improvement
- **Integration Testing**: Need more cross-component tests
- **Performance Testing**: Need benchmarks for routing decisions
- **Error Scenarios**: More edge case handling
- **Configuration**: Simplify configuration management

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Redis over PostgreSQL** for memory: Better performance for agent operations
2. **Pydantic for all models**: Type safety and validation
3. **Circuit breaker pattern**: Prevent cascade failures
4. **Message importance scoring**: Intelligent context compression
5. **Prometheus native**: Production monitoring from day one

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- Agent failures (automatic recovery)

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Proceed with Option 1**: Complete the Base Agent Framework in a mini-sprint (Sprint 1.2.5) before moving to Sprint 1.3. This ensures:

1. **Architectural Integrity**: All agents built on solid foundation
2. **Code Reuse**: Shared functionality across all agents  
3. **Easier Testing**: Common test patterns
4. **Better Maintenance**: Consistent agent behavior

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Sprint 1.2.5 (Base Agent): 1 week
- Sprint 1.3 (CTO Agent): 1 week  
- Sprint 2.1 (Orchestration): 2 weeks

This puts us on track to have **multi-agent collaboration within 4 weeks**!
