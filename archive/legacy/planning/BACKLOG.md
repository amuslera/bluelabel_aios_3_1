# AIOSv3 Product Backlog

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision
A collaborative AI development system where human product owners work with AI agents to build software iteratively, with full visibility and control throughout the process.

## ðŸ“‹ Backlog Items

### 1. Enhanced Agent Visibility & Reporting
**Priority: High** | **Epic: Developer Experience**

#### 1.1 Real-time Activity Streaming
- Agents should output detailed logs of what they're doing as they work
- Include decision-making rationale ("Analyzing task requirements...", "Choosing FastAPI because...")
- Show file operations in progress ("Reading models/user.py...", "Writing tests/test_auth.py...")
- Display current thought process and next steps

#### 1.2 Final Work Reports
- Each agent produces a summary report when completing a task
- Include: files created/modified, decisions made, issues encountered
- Provide metrics: lines of code, test coverage, time spent
- Highlight any concerns or recommendations

#### 1.3 Agent Status Indicators
- Show agent state: idle, thinking, coding, testing, blocked
- Display current task and progress percentage
- Show resource usage and performance metrics

### 2. Real-time Dashboard Terminal
**Priority: High** | **Epic: Monitoring & Control**

#### 2.1 Task Management Dashboard
- Live view of all tasks: pending, in-progress, completed, blocked
- Task assignments and agent workload
- Gantt chart or timeline view of sprint progress
- Dependencies and blockers visualization

#### 2.2 Performance Metrics
- Agent efficiency metrics (tasks/hour, code quality scores)
- System resource usage (API calls, compute time)
- Cost tracking (LLM API costs per agent/task)
- Quality metrics (test coverage, linting scores)

#### 2.3 Collaboration Timeline
- Real-time feed of all agent activities
- Message history with filtering
- Decision log with rationale
- File change history

### 3. Iterative Development Process
**Priority: High** | **Epic: Process Improvement**

#### 3.1 Sprint Planning Enhancement
- Interactive planning session with AI Technical Lead
- Define user stories with acceptance criteria
- AI suggests task breakdown and estimates
- Human approves/modifies before execution

#### 3.2 Review Checkpoints
- Configurable review points (after design, after implementation, after testing)
- Demo functionality at each checkpoint
- Human can approve, request changes, or pivot
- AI team adapts based on feedback

#### 3.3 Continuous Iteration
- Post-completion feedback loops
- "Fix this bug" â†’ QA agent investigates â†’ Backend fixes
- "Add this feature" â†’ CTO designs â†’ Team implements
- "Change this UI" â†’ Frontend updates â†’ QA validates

### 4. Enhanced Collaboration Features
**Priority: Medium** | **Epic: Team Dynamics**

#### 4.1 Human-AI Pair Programming
- Human can jump into any agent's work
- Co-edit files with AI agents
- Real-time code review and suggestions
- Shared debugging sessions

#### 4.2 Smart Task Routing
- Tasks automatically routed to best agent
- Load balancing across team
- Skill-based assignment
- Priority queue management

#### 4.3 Knowledge Sharing
- Agents share learnings across sessions
- Build team knowledge base
- Document patterns and decisions
- Learn from past projects

### 5. Product Quality Controls
**Priority: Medium** | **Epic: Quality Assurance**

#### 5.1 Automated Quality Gates
- Code must pass linting before commit
- Tests required for new features
- Security scanning on dependencies
- Performance benchmarks

#### 5.2 Human Approval Workflows
- Configurable approval points
- Architecture review before implementation
- Code review before merge
- Demo before deployment

### 6. Developer Experience Improvements
**Priority: Medium** | **Epic: Usability**

#### 6.1 Natural Language Commands
- "Show me what Backend Dev is working on"
- "Have CTO review the authentication design"
- "Ask QA to prioritize security tests"
- "Show me all completed tasks today"

#### 6.2 Project Templates
- Pre-configured team compositions
- Common project structures (API, Web App, CLI)
- Best practice implementations
- Quick-start guides

### 7. Advanced Features (Future)
**Priority: Low** | **Epic: Innovation**

#### 7.1 Multi-Project Management
- Agents work on multiple projects
- Resource allocation across projects
- Inter-project knowledge transfer

#### 7.2 Custom Agent Creation
- Define new specialist roles
- Train agents on specific domains
- Company-specific agents

#### 7.3 CI/CD Integration
- Automatic deployment pipelines
- Integration with GitHub/GitLab
- Automated release management

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Visibility & Monitoring (Sprint 1.4)
1. Implement real-time activity streaming
2. Create dashboard terminal
3. Add agent status indicators

### Phase 2: Collaborative Workflows (Sprint 1.5)
1. Add review checkpoints
2. Implement feedback loops
3. Enable human intervention points

### Phase 3: Quality & Polish (Sprint 1.6)
1. Add quality gates
2. Improve natural language interface
3. Create project templates

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- **Visibility**: 100% of agent actions are observable
- **Control**: Human can intervene at any point
- **Quality**: 0 bugs reach production without human review
- **Efficiency**: 50% reduction in development time vs manual
- **Satisfaction**: High user satisfaction scores

## ðŸ’¡ Key Principles
1. **Human in Control**: AI assists, human decides
2. **Full Transparency**: Every action is visible and explainable
3. **Iterative by Design**: Built for continuous improvement
4. **Quality First**: Better to be right than fast
5. **Collaborative**: AI and human working together, not replacing
