# AIOSv3 Implementation Plan - Tailored Approach

## Your Setup Analysis

### Hardware Capabilities
Your Mac Mini M4 Pro with 48GB RAM is excellent for running local LLMs:
- Can run Llama 3 70B quantized models
- Can run multiple 7B-13B models simultaneously
- Perfect for DeepSeek Coder 33B
- Neural Engine will accelerate inference

Your MacBook Pro with Ollama is perfect for development and testing smaller models.

### Budget Optimization
Your current $300+/month AI subscription budget can be redirected:
- Keep Claude MAX for complex tasks
- Use API credits instead of subscriptions where possible
- Allocate saved budget to cloud compute if needed

## Revised Phase 1 Plan (Weeks 1-2) - "Build the Builders"

### Week 1: Foundation & First Builder Agent

**Day 1-2: Core Setup**
```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOSv3

# 2. Create initial project structure
mkdir -p agents/base agents/specialists core/routing config
mkdir -p infrastructure/docker api scripts tests/unit

# 3. Initialize Python environment
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain langgraph pydantic redis

# 4. Set up Ollama on Mac Mini
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3:70b-instruct-q4_K_M  # Quantized for your RAM
ollama pull deepseek-coder:33b-instruct-q4_K_M
ollama pull codellama:34b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

**Day 3-4: CTO Agent (Your Interface)**
Create the CTO agent that will:
- Communicate with you about project requirements
- Break down tasks for other agents
- Coordinate the agent team
- Make architectural decisions

```python
# agents/specialists/cto_agent.py
from agents.base import BaseAgent
from core.routing import LLMRouter

class CTOAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    The CTO Agent acts as the main interface between you and the agent team.
    Uses Claude Code for complex reasoning and architectural decisions.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="CTO Agent",
            primary_model="claude-code",  # Another Claude Code instance
            fallback_model="llama3:70b",
            capabilities=[
                "project_planning",
                "task_decomposition", 
                "architecture_design",
                "team_coordination"
            ]
        )
```

**Day 5-7: Builder Agent Template**
Create a reusable template for builder agents:

```python
# agents/specialists/builder_agent.py
class BuilderAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    Template for agents that build other agents.
    Self-replicating pattern for expanding the team.
    """
    
    def create_agent(self, agent_spec):
        """Generate code for a new specialized agent"""
        # Use code generation capabilities
        # Create agent file structure
        # Generate tests
        # Update configuration
```

### Week 2: Multi-Agent Coordination

**Day 8-10: Basic Orchestration**
- Implement simple task queue using Redis
- Create workflow engine for agent collaboration
- Set up inter-agent communication

**Day 11-12: First Product Build**
Test the system by having agents build a simple product:
1. CTO Agent receives requirements from you
2. CTO creates task breakdown
3. Builder Agent creates specialized agents as needed
4. Agents collaborate to build the product

**Day 13-14: Iteration & Refinement**
- Refine agent communication
- Improve task delegation
- Add basic monitoring

## Revised Architecture for "Building Builders"

```
You (CEO) <--> CTO Agent <--> Orchestrator
                                    |
                    +---------------+---------------+
                    |               |               |
              Builder Agent   Backend Agent   Frontend Agent
                    |         (created by      (created by
                    |          Builder)         Builder)
                    v
              Creates new specialized agents on demand
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Use Claude Code as Primary "Brain"
Since you have Claude MAX subscription:
- Use Claude Code API for CTO Agent (complex reasoning)
- Use local models for specialized coding tasks
- This maximizes your existing investment

### 2. Leverage Your Mac Mini as Local Compute
```yaml
# config/models.yaml
models:
  claude-code:
    type: cloud
    provider: anthropic
    model: claude-3-opus-20240229
    use_for: ["planning", "architecture", "complex_reasoning"]
    
  llama3-70b:
    type: local
    provider: ollama
    endpoint: http://localhost:11434
    model: llama3:70b-instruct-q4_K_M
    use_for: ["code_generation", "general_tasks"]
    
  deepseek-coder:
    type: local
    provider: ollama
    endpoint: http://localhost:11434
    model: deepseek-coder:33b-instruct-q4_K_M
    use_for: ["code_generation", "code_review"]
```

### 3. Rapid Prototyping Approach
Instead of building everything upfront:
1. Start with CTO Agent + one Builder Agent
2. Have Builder create new agents as needed
3. Each new agent can help build the next
4. System grows organically based on needs

### 4. Development Workflow
```bash
# Your daily workflow
1. Talk to CTO Agent about what to build
2. CTO Agent creates plan and delegates
3. Builder Agent creates new specialists
4. Monitor progress via simple dashboard
5. Iterate and improve
```

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Set up the basic structure
cat > setup.py << 'EOF'
import os
import json

# Create directory structure
dirs = [
    "agents/base", "agents/specialists", "agents/builders",
    "core/routing", "core/orchestration", "core/memory",
    "config", "api/routes", "tests"
]

for dir in dirs:
    os.makedirs(dir, exist_ok=True)
    # Add __init__.py for Python packages
    if not dir.startswith("config"):
        open(os.path.join(dir, "__init__.py"), 'a').close()

# Create initial config
config = {
    "agents": {
        "cto": {
            "model": "claude-code",
            "temperature": 0.7
        }
    }
}

with open("config/agents.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(config, f, indent=2)

print("âœ… Project structure created!")
EOF

python setup.py

# 2. Install core dependencies
pip install langchain langgraph fastapi uvicorn redis ollama-python

# 3. Start Ollama
ollama serve

# 4. Pull models (in another terminal)
ollama pull llama3:70b-instruct-q4_K_M
ollama pull deepseek-coder:33b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Today**: Set up the basic project structure and install dependencies
2. **Tomorrow**: Create the CTO Agent that can talk with you
3. **Day 3**: Implement the Builder Agent that can create other agents
4. **Day 4**: Test by having Builder create a simple Backend Agent
5. **Week 2**: Refine and expand based on what you learn

## Key Advantages of This Approach

1. **Immediate Value**: You can start "hiring" AI employees within days
2. **Self-Expanding**: The system builds itself as needed
3. **Cost Effective**: Leverages your powerful local hardware
4. **Learning System**: Each iteration improves the builders
5. **Your Vision**: Truly building the builders, not just the products

## Questions to Consider

1. **First Product**: What should be the first real product the agents build to test the system?
2. **Agent Specializations**: Beyond backend/frontend, what specialized roles do you envision?
3. **Communication Style**: How would you prefer to interact with the CTO Agent? Chat? Project boards? Both?
4. **Success Metrics**: How will you measure if the agents are effectively building what you need?
