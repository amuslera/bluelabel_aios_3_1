# Multi-Agent Workflow Roadmap

## Current Status: ✅ CTO Agent + Demo Framework

## Next Development Phases:

### Phase 1: Real Agent Implementation (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Backend Developer Agent** 
  - Implement actual code generation
  - File creation and modification
  - Integration with existing codebase
  
- [ ] **QA Agent**
  - Automated test generation
  - Test execution and reporting
  - Code quality analysis

### Phase 2: Code Execution (1 week)
- [ ] **File System Integration**
  - Create/modify files based on agent recommendations
  - Git workflow automation
  - Safe execution environment

- [ ] **Testing Automation**
  - Run generated tests
  - Validate implementations
  - Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Enhanced Collaboration (1 week)
- [ ] **Agent-to-Agent Communication**
  - Agents consulting each other
  - Collaborative decision making
  - Conflict resolution

- [ ] **Interactive Planning Sessions**
  - Multi-agent planning meetings
  - Human oversight and approval
  - Iterative refinement

### Phase 4: Production Features (2 weeks)
- [ ] **Web Interface**
  - Real-time collaboration dashboard
  - Visual workflow progress
  - Interactive agent management

- [ ] **Advanced Orchestration**
  - Complex workflow automation
  - Parallel task execution
  - Dependency management

## Example Workflows We Can Build:

### 1. Feature Development
```
Human: "Add user authentication to the web API"
├── CTO Agent: Architecture planning
├── Backend Dev: API implementation  
├── Frontend Dev: UI components
├── QA Agent: Test suite creation
├── Security Agent: Security review
└── Claude Code: Execute & deploy
```

### 2. Bug Investigation
```
Human: "Users report slow response times"
├── CTO Agent: System analysis
├── Performance Agent: Profiling & metrics
├── Backend Dev: Code optimization
├── DevOps Agent: Infrastructure review
└── Claude Code: Implement fixes
```

### 3. Code Review
```
Human: "Review this pull request"
├── CTO Agent: Architecture impact
├── Security Agent: Security analysis
├── Performance Agent: Performance impact
├── Code Quality Agent: Best practices
└── Claude Code: Consolidated feedback
```

## Technical Implementation:

### Agent Framework Extensions
```python
class WorkflowAgent(EnhancedBaseAgent):
    async def collaborate_with(self, other_agents: List[Agent], task: Task):
        # Multi-agent coordination
        pass
    
    async def execute_code_changes(self, specifications: Dict):
        # Actual file modifications
        pass
```

### Workflow Orchestration
```python
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    async def plan_and_execute(self, human_request: str):
        # 1. Break down request
        # 2. Assign to appropriate agents
        # 3. Coordinate execution
        # 4. Validate results
        # 5. Deploy changes
        pass
```

## What You'll Experience:

1. **Natural Conversation**
   - "I want to add a new feature"
   - Agents discuss and plan together
   - You approve/modify the approach

2. **Live Code Generation**
   - Watch files being created/modified
   - See tests being written and run
   - Review before execution

3. **Real Deployments**
   - Actual code commits
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Production deployments

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Track AI costs across workflow
   - Optimize agent usage
   - Budget management

## Getting Started:

1. **Try Current Demo**: 
   ```bash
   python3 workflow_collaboration_demo.py
   ```

2. **Interactive CTO Agent**:
   ```bash
   python3 live_collaboration_terminal.py
   ```

3. **Next: Backend Dev Agent**
   - Clone CTO Agent pattern
   - Specialize for code generation
   - Integrate with file system

This roadmap shows how we can go from current demo to a fully functional multi-agent development team that actually writes, tests, and deploys code!
