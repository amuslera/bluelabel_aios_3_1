# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded by consolidated documents in the root directory.

## Why These Files Are Archived

We consolidated multiple overlapping documents into single sources of truth to:
- Eliminate confusion from duplicate information
- Make documentation easier to maintain
- Provide clear, authoritative references
- Speed up agent and developer onboarding

## Current Documentation Structure

The active documentation is now organized as follows:

### Root Directory (Single Sources of Truth)
- **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Consolidates all vision, status, and roadmap information
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Consolidates all technical architecture decisions
- **DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md** - Defines how we work (sprints, standards, etc.)
- **AGENT_ROSTER.md** - Defines all agents and their roles
- **CLAUDE.md** - Project-specific instructions

### Organized Directories
- **agents/onboarding/** - Self-contained onboarding file for each agent type
- **templates/** - Reusable templates for all processes
- **standards/** - Coding and quality standards
- **sprints/active/** - Current sprint information only
- **sprints/completed/** - Historical sprint records

## When to Reference These Files

Only reference these archived files when:
- You need historical context about decisions
- You're looking for specific details not in the consolidated docs
- You're doing a post-mortem or retrospective

For all current work, use the consolidated documents in the root directory.
