## Demo Instructions

To see the handoff system in action:

```bash
# Run the interactive demo
python3 demos/hermes_handoff_demo.py

# Or run the E2E test
python3 src/agents/specialists/hermes/test_e2e_handoff.py
```

## Conclusion

Sprint 3.4 successfully delivered a complete multi-agent handoff system that transforms natural conversations into actionable development plans. The system intelligently decomposes projects, assigns tasks to specialist agents, and maintains ongoing communication throughout development.

The platform can now take any software idea expressed in plain language and automatically orchestrate a team of AI agents to build it. This represents a major milestone in achieving the vision of natural language software development.
