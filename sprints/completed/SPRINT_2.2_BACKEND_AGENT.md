## Technical Design

### Marcus Agent Architecture
```
MarcusAgent(MonitoringAgent)
    ├── Personality System
    │   ├── Communication style
    │   ├── Technical preferences
    │   └── Collaboration patterns
    ├── Skill Modules
    │   ├── FastAPI expertise
    │   ├── Database design
    │   ├── API patterns
    │   └── Performance optimization
    └── LLM Integration
        ├── Task routing
        ├── Code generation
        └── Decision making
```

### LLM Usage Strategy
- **Simple completions** → Ollama (docstrings, variable names)
- **API design** → GPT-4-Turbo (good balance)
- **Complex architecture** → Claude-3.5-Sonnet (when needed)
- **Target**: 80% local model usage for Marcus

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM costs exceed budget | Medium | Strict routing rules, monitor costs |
| Personality inconsistency | Low | Define clear personality traits |
| Code quality issues | Medium | Implement validation and testing |
| Integration complexity | Low | Use existing MonitoringAgent base |

## Definition of Done
- [x] Marcus successfully creates a complete CRUD API
- [x] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Monitoring integration verified
- [ ] Cost tracking shows <$0.01 average (pending production metrics)
- [x] Demo recorded

## Sprint Ceremonies
- **Daily Updates**: Via git commits and sprint doc updates
- **Mid-Sprint Review**: After BA-004 completion
- **Sprint Demo**: Marcus builds a task management API
- **Retrospective**: Document learnings for next agents

## Knowledge Transfer
At sprint completion, document:
1. Patterns that worked well for agent personality
2. LLM routing decisions and costs
3. Code generation techniques
4. Integration challenges and solutions
