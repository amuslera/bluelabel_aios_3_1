# Current Sprint: 3.3 - Multi-Agent Handoff

**Sprint**: 3.3  
**Phase**: 3 - Production Hardening  
**Started**: June 3, 2025  
**Status**: NOT STARTED

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Connect Hermes (Concierge) to the specialist agents, enabling seamless handoff from natural conversation to project execution. Create the orchestration layer that transforms user requirements into coordinated agent tasks.

## 📋 Sprint Tasks

### Task 1: Project Brief Generation
- [ ] Design project brief schema
- [ ] Create brief generation from Hermes sessions
- [ ] Implement requirement validation
- [ ] Add completeness scoring

### Task 2: Agent Task Assignment
- [ ] Build task decomposition engine
- [ ] Create agent capability matching
- [ ] Implement priority-based assignment
- [ ] Design task dependency graph

### Task 3: Orchestration Workflow
- [ ] Connect Hermes to Hera (Project CTO placeholder)
- [ ] Implement agent task distribution
- [ ] Create coordination protocols
- [ ] Build progress tracking

### Task 4: Communication Bridge
- [ ] Design handoff message format
- [ ] Implement agent activation sequence
- [ ] Create status update flow
- [ ] Build error handling

### Task 5: End-to-End Demo
- [ ] Create bakery website demo
- [ ] Show full conversation → development flow
- [ ] Demonstrate agent collaboration
- [ ] Export complete project log

### Task 6: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test Hermes → Agent handoff
- [ ] Validate task assignment logic
- [ ] Verify progress tracking
- [ ] Load test orchestration

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

1. **Seamless Handoff**: User can go from conversation to active development
2. **Clear Brief**: Generated project briefs contain all needed information
3. **Smart Assignment**: Tasks assigned to appropriate agents based on capabilities
4. **Real Progress**: Visible progress as agents work on tasks
5. **Error Recovery**: System handles failures gracefully

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

- Working orchestration between Hermes and specialist agents
- Automated project kickoff from conversation
- Demonstrable end-to-end workflow
- Foundation for production multi-agent systems

## 📝 Notes

This sprint bridges the gap between conversational AI and autonomous development. Focus on creating a smooth, reliable handoff that maintains context and ensures successful project delivery.

Key Integration Points:
- Hermes conversation state → Project brief
- Project brief → Agent tasks
- Agent tasks → Coordinated execution
- Execution → User-visible progress
