# Sprint "Foundation Completion" - Control Center & Monitoring

**Duration**: June 2025 (1-2 weeks)  
**Sprint Goal**: Complete foundational visibility and control systems  
**Status**: Planning

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

### Primary Goal (80%)
Complete the Control Center and Monitoring system to provide full visibility and control over AI agents

### Secondary Goal (20%)  
Test multi-agent coordination and identify integration issues

## 📊 Current Assessment

### What We Have
1. **Monitoring Server** - Basic WebSocket server (50% complete)
   - ✅ WebSocket endpoints
   - ✅ Activity storage
   - ❌ Authentication missing
   - ❌ Error handling incomplete
   - ❌ No persistent storage

2. **Control Center UI** - Textual-based TUI (30% complete)
   - ✅ Basic grid layout
   - ✅ Component structure
   - ❌ No real data integration
   - ❌ No WebSocket connection
   - ❌ No agent management

3. **Agent Framework** - Production ready (90% complete)
   - ✅ BaseAgent with lifecycle
   - ✅ LLM routing
   - ✅ Memory management
   - ⚠️ Limited real-world testing

## 🎯 Sprint Requirements

### Monitoring System (MUST HAVE)

   - Rate limiting

2. **Data Persistence**
   - SQLite database for activities
   - Activity retention policies
   - Historical query performance

3. **Error Handling**
   - Connection recovery
   - Graceful degradation
   - Comprehensive logging

4. **Performance**
   - Handle 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections
   - <100ms API response times
   - Efficient data storage

### Control Center UI (MUST HAVE)
1. **Real-time Agent Monitoring**
   - Live agent status display
   - Activity feed with filtering
   - Performance metrics

2. **Task Management**
   - Assign tasks to agents
   - Track task progress
   - Cancel/modify tasks

3. **System Overview**
   - System health dashboard
   - Resource utilization
   - Error summary

4. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive keyboard navigation
   - Responsive layout
   - Clear visual hierarchy

### Integration (SHOULD HAVE)
1. **Agent Registration**
   - Agents auto-register with monitoring
   - Health check integration
   - Capability discovery

2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Task dependencies
   - Agent communication
   - Workflow orchestration

## 📋 Detailed Task Breakdown

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure

- [ ] **MON-002**: Implement SQLite persistence layer
- [ ] **MON-003**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- [ ] **MON-004**: Performance optimization and load testing

**Days 4-5: Control Center Foundation**
- [ ] **CC-001**: Implement WebSocket client in Control Center
- [ ] **CC-002**: Create real-time agent status display
- [ ] **CC-003**: Build activity feed with real data

### Week 2: Integration & Polish
**Days 6-8: Control Center Features**
- [ ] **CC-004**: Implement task assignment interface
- [ ] **CC-005**: Add system health dashboard
- [ ] **CC-006**: Polish UI/UX and keyboard shortcuts

**Days 9-10: Integration Testing**
- [ ] **INT-001**: Agent auto-registration with monitoring
- [ ] **INT-002**: Multi-agent workflow testing
- [ ] **INT-003**: End-to-end system validation

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Agent → Monitoring Server → SQLite
               ↓
        WebSocket Stream → Control Center UI
```

### Components Integration
- **Agents**: Report status via HTTP POST to monitoring server
- **Monitoring Server**: Stores activities, streams to WebSocket clients
- **Control Center**: Connects via WebSocket, displays real-time data
- **Task Assignment**: Control Center → Agent via direct API calls

## ✅ Definition of Done

### Monitoring System
- [ ] Authentication working (API keys)
- [ ] All activities persisted to SQLite
- [ ] WebSocket handles 50+ concurrent connections
- [ ] 95% uptime during 24hr test
- [ ] Complete error handling and logging

### Control Center
- [ ] Real-time agent status (refreshes every 5s)
- [ ] Can assign tasks to agents
- [ ] Shows system health metrics
- [ ] Intuitive keyboard navigation
- [ ] Responsive to terminal resize

### Integration
- [ ] Agents auto-register on startup
- [ ] Can coordinate 2+ agents on shared task
- [ ] All agent activities visible in Control Center
- [ ] Human can manage entire AI team from one interface

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Visibility**: 100% of agent activities visible in real-time
- **Control**: Can assign/cancel tasks without command line
- **Performance**: <2 second response time for all UI actions
- **Reliability**: System handles agent crashes gracefully
- **Usability**: New user can understand interface in <5 minutes

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

1. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Implement reconnection logic
   - Fallback to polling mode
   - Connection health monitoring

2. **Database Performance**
   - Activity data pagination
   - Background cleanup jobs
   - Query optimization

3. **UI Complexity**
   - Start with basic layout
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Extensive user testing
