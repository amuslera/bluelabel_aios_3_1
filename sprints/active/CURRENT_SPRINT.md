## 🎯 Recommendation: Sprint 2.3 - Frontend Agent

I recommend proceeding with **Sprint 2.3: Frontend Agent Implementation** for Emily Rodriguez.

**Sprint 2.3 Structure** (following Sprint 2.2's successful pattern):
1. FE-001: Create Emily base agent class
2. FE-002: Implement Emily's personality system
3. FE-003: Add React component generation
4. FE-004: Add UI/UX design capabilities
5. FE-005: Implement CSS-in-JS styling
6. FE-006: Add accessibility features
7. FE-007: Create Emily test suite
8. FE-008: Demo: Emily builds a dashboard

**Expected Duration**: 1-2 sessions (based on backend agent velocity)

## 🔄 Sprint 2.3 Transition

To start Sprint 2.3:
1. Create `SPRINT_2.3_FRONTEND_AGENT.md` with detailed plan
2. Define Emily's personality traits
3. Set up React/Vue generation templates
4. Plan integration points with Marcus

**Architecture Consideration**: Emily should be able to:
- Receive API specs from Marcus
