# Current Sprint: 3.3 - Hermes LLM Integration

**Sprint**: 3.3  
**Phase**: 3 - Production Hardening  
**Started**: June 3, 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Connect Hermes to real LLMs (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and local Ollama) with smart routing to minimize costs while providing intelligent, context-aware conversations. Transform Hermes from demo mode to a truly helpful concierge.

## 📋 Sprint Tasks

### Task 3: Enhanced Intent Detection 🎯
- [ ] Use LLM for nuanced intent understanding
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring with LLM
- [ ] Add intent clarification prompts
- [ ] Create intent-specific conversation flows
- [ ] Build use case pattern library

### Task 4: Cost Optimization 💰
- [ ] Implement request complexity scoring
- [ ] Route simple intents to Ollama
- [ ] Use Claude only for complex requirements extraction
- [ ] Add token counting and cost tracking
- [ ] Create routing metrics dashboard

### Task 5: Real Conversation Testing 🗣️
- [ ] Test "read later digest" automation flow
- [ ] Test e-commerce site requirements gathering
- [ ] Test non-technical user interactions

## 🚀 Key Focus Areas

1. **Real LLM Integration** - No more canned responses!
2. **Cost-Effective Routing** - Local first, cloud when needed
3. **Natural Conversations** - Context-aware, helpful responses
4. **Non-Technical Support** - Plain language for all users

## 📊 Success Criteria

- ✅ Hermes provides unique, contextual responses
- ✅ 80%+ requests handled by local Ollama
- ✅ Correctly identifies user intent (>90% accuracy)
- ✅ Handles test cases from user feedback
- ✅ Cost per conversation < $0.01

## 🔥 Current Focus
