## 📋 Detailed Task Breakdown

### Week 1: Core Agent Intelligence

**Days 1-2: LLM Integration Foundation**
- [ ] **LLM-001**: Implement LLM client with provider routing
- [ ] **LLM-002**: Add Claude-3.5-Sonnet integration
- [ ] **LLM-003**: Add cost-optimized model selection
- [ ] **LLM-004**: Implement context management and memory

**Days 3-5: Specialized Agent Implementation**
- [ ] **AGT-001**: ~~Implement CTO Agent (Sarah Kim)~~ **POSTPONED** - Platform CTO handles this role
- [ ] **AGT-002**: Implement Backend Agent (Marcus Chen) with FastAPI expertise **PRIORITY 1**

- [ ] **AGT-004**: Implement QA Agent (Sam Martinez) with testing frameworks
- [ ] **AGT-005**: Implement DevOps Agent (Jordan Kim) with deployment skills

**Decision Note**: Sarah (Project CTO) implementation postponed. Platform CTO (current Claude instance) will handle both Platform and Project CTO responsibilities to learn optimal patterns before implementing Sarah. This allows hands-on learning of what works best for project coordination.

**Days 6-8: Agent Personalities & Communication**
- [ ] **PER-001**: Add personality systems to all agents
- [ ] **PER-002**: Implement agent-to-agent communication protocols

- [ ] **PER-004**: Create conflict resolution and escalation mechanisms

**Days 9-10: Workflow Orchestration**
- [ ] **WF-001**: Build project workflow orchestration
- [ ] **WF-002**: Implement human approval gates
