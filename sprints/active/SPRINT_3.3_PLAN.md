# Sprint 3.3: Hermes LLM Integration & Smart Routing

**Sprint**: 3.3  
**Phase**: 3 - Production Hardening  
**Duration**: 1-2 sessions  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: PLANNED

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Connect Hermes to real LLMs (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and local Ollama) with smart routing to minimize costs while providing intelligent, context-aware conversations. Transform Hermes from demo mode to a truly helpful concierge.

## 📋 Revised Sprint Tasks

### Task 1: LLM Router Integration ✨
- [ ] Connect HermesAgent to existing LLMRouter
- [ ] Configure routing rules for Hermes-specific needs
- [ ] Set up Ollama as primary (85% target) with cloud fallback
- [ ] Implement conversation memory with Redis
- [ ] Add context window management

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Hermes uses local Ollama for simple queries
- Falls back to Claude for complex understanding
- Maintains conversation context across turns

### Task 2: Smart Response Generation 🧠
- [ ] Replace fallback responses with LLM generation
- [ ] Implement dynamic system prompts based on intent
- [ ] Add conversation history to prompts
- [ ] Create token-efficient prompt templates
- [ ] Handle LLM failures gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Every response is contextually relevant
- No more repeated/canned responses
- Graceful degradation if LLM fails

### Task 3: Enhanced Intent Detection 🎯
- [ ] Use LLM for nuanced intent understanding
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring with LLM
- [ ] Add intent clarification prompts
- [ ] Create intent-specific conversation flows
- [ ] Build use case pattern library

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Correctly identifies "read later digest" as AUTOMATE
- Asks relevant follow-up questions
- Confidence scores reflect actual understanding

### Task 4: Cost Optimization 💰
- [ ] Implement request complexity scoring
- [ ] Route simple intents to Ollama
- [ ] Use Claude only for complex requirements extraction  
- [ ] Add token counting and cost tracking
- [ ] Create routing metrics dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 80%+ requests handled by local LLM
- Cloud LLM usage < $0.01 per conversation
- Visible cost tracking per session

### Task 5: Real Conversation Testing 🗣️
- [ ] Test "read later digest" automation flow
- [ ] Test e-commerce site requirements gathering
- [ ] Test non-technical user interactions
- [ ] Validate intent detection accuracy
- [ ] Measure response quality improvement

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Handles all BACKLOG test cases correctly
- Non-technical users can describe projects
- Intent detection accuracy > 90%

### Task 6: Integration & Polish 🔧
- [ ] Update chat_with_hermes.py to use full agent
- [ ] Create configuration for API keys
- [ ] Add conversation quality metrics
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create demo video

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Simple setup for new users
- Clear documentation on configuration
- Demo shows real conversations

## 🚀 Technical Approach

### LLM Routing Strategy
```python
# Pseudo-code for routing logic
complexity = assess_query_complexity(user_input)
if complexity < 3:  # Simple greeting, basic info
    use_ollama("mistral:latest")
elif complexity < 7:  # Standard requirements gathering
    use_ollama("mistral:latest") with fallback to OpenAI
else:  # Complex understanding needed
    use_claude("claude-3-haiku")  # Fast and smart
```

### Conversation Memory
- Store last 10 turns in Redis
- Include intent evolution in prompts
- Track extracted requirements
- Maintain persona consistency

### Cost Targets
- Ollama: 85% of requests (FREE)
- OpenAI: 10% of requests (~$0.002/conv)
- Claude: 5% of requests (~$0.005/conv)
- Average cost per conversation: < $0.001

## 📊 Success Metrics

1. **Response Quality**
   - No repeated responses ✓
   - Context-aware replies ✓
   - Helpful clarifications ✓

2. **Intent Accuracy**
   - Correct categorization > 90%
   - Confidence alignment with actual understanding
   - Reduced user frustration

3. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Local LLM usage > 80%
   - Per-conversation cost < $0.01
   - No unnecessary cloud calls

4. **User Experience**
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Non-technical friendly
   - Clear next steps

## 🔗 Dependencies

- Working LLMRouter (✓ from Sprint 2.1)
- Redis for memory (✓ installed)
- API keys in .env (✓ confirmed)
- Ollama running locally (✓ mistral:latest)

## 📝 Notes

This sprint transforms Hermes from a demo to a production-ready concierge. Focus on:
1. Making conversations feel natural and helpful
2. Keeping costs minimal with smart routing
3. Ensuring non-technical users can succeed
4. Building on existing infrastructure

The goal is for users to say "Wow, Hermes really understood what I needed!" instead of getting generic responses.

## Example Test Conversations

### Test 1: Read Later Digest
```
User: I save lots of articles but never read them
Hermes: I understand! You want to stay informed but struggle with information overload. 
        Would you like me to help create an automated digest that summarizes your 
        saved articles? I could set it up to:
        - Pull articles from your reading list (Pocket, Instapaper, etc.)
        - Create daily or weekly summaries
        - Highlight key insights
        - Send to your email or preferred app
        
        What reading app do you currently use to save articles?
```

### Test 2: Non-Technical E-commerce
```
User: I make handmade jewelry and want to sell online
Hermes: Wonderful! Handmade jewelry deserves a beautiful online showcase. 
        Let me help you create the perfect online store. 
        
        To design the best solution for your business, could you tell me:
        - How many pieces do you typically have available? 
        - Do you create custom orders?
        - Do you already have photos of your work?
