## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Handoff Architecture
```
User → Hermes → ProjectBrief → Orchestrator → Agents
         ↓                          ↓            ↓
    Conversation              Task Assignment  Development
         ↓                          ↓            ↓
    Requirements                Coordination   Delivery
```

### Key Components

1. **ProjectBrief Schema**
   - Project type and description
   - Technical requirements
   - User personas
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Timeline and budget

2. **Task Assignment Algorithm**
   - Capability scoring
   - Workload distribution
   - Dependency resolution
   - Priority ordering

3. **Agent Communication Protocol**
   - Standardized message format
   - Status update events
   - Progress milestones
   - Error reporting

## 📊 Success Criteria

- ✅ Hermes can hand off to specialist agents
- ✅ Complete project delivered from conversation
- ✅ All agents collaborate effectively
- ✅ Clear progress visibility throughout
- ✅ <5 minute handoff time

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes

1. **Seamless User Experience**
   - Natural conversation → Working software
   - No technical knowledge required
   - Real-time progress updates

2. **Efficient Development**
   - Parallel agent execution
   - Automatic task distribution
   - Smart dependency management

3. **Quality Delivery**
   - All specialists engaged appropriately
   - Comprehensive testing by Athena
   - Production deployment by Hephaestus

## 🔥 Current Focus

Starting with Task 1 - creating the ProjectBrief generation system to transform Hermes conversations into structured development plans.

## Previous Sprint

**Sprint 3.3**: Hermes LLM Integration ✅
- Connected real LLMs (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI)
- Achieved 85%+ local routing
- Natural, contextual conversations
- <$0.001 per conversation cost

## Next Sprint

**Sprint 3.5**: Production Deployment
- Load testing at scale
- Horizontal scaling setup
- Production monitoring
- Final optimizations

## 📝 Notes

This sprint represents the culmination of our multi-agent platform - where conversations become code. The handoff mechanism is critical for demonstrating the full power of our AI development team.
