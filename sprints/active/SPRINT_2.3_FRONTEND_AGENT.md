### Emily's Personality Profile
- **Name**: Emily Rodriguez
- **Role**: Frontend Development Specialist
- **Core Traits**:
  - **Creative** (0.9): Innovative UI solutions, aesthetic focus
  - **Detail-oriented** (0.85): Pixel-perfect implementations
  - **User-focused** (0.9): Always considers user experience
  - **Collaborative** (0.8): Works well with backend developers
  - **Accessibility-minded** (0.85): Inclusive design advocate

### LLM Usage Strategy
- **Simple components** → Ollama (buttons, inputs, basic layouts)
- **Complex UI logic** → GPT-4-Turbo (state management, forms)
- **Design systems** → Claude-3.5-Sonnet (architecture decisions)
- **Target**: 80% local model usage for Emily

## Collaboration with Marcus

### Integration Points
- **API Integration**: Emily receives OpenAPI specs from Marcus
- **Component Generation**: Creates matching frontend for Marcus's endpoints
- **Shared Workspace**: Both agents work on full-stack features
- **Design Handoffs**: Emily provides design specs, Marcus implements data layer

### Message Queue Topics
- `frontend.components` - Component generation requests
- `api.integration` - Frontend-backend integration
- `design.review` - Design feedback and iteration
- `accessibility.check` - A11y compliance validation

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| UI framework complexity | Medium | Start with React, add Vue later |
| Design consistency | Medium | Create design system templates |
| Accessibility compliance | High | Build A11y checks into generation |
| Performance optimization | Low | Focus on clean component generation |

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Emily successfully creates a complete React dashboard
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Monitoring integration verified
- [ ] Collaboration with Marcus demonstrated
- [ ] Demo recorded

## Sprint Ceremonies
- **Daily Updates**: Via git commits and sprint doc updates
- **Mid-Sprint Review**: After FE-004 completion
- **Sprint Demo**: Emily builds a task management dashboard
- **Retrospective**: Document learnings for QA agent

## Knowledge Transfer
At sprint completion, document:
1. Patterns that worked well for frontend agent personality
2. Component generation techniques and templates
3. Frontend-backend collaboration workflows
4. UI accessibility implementation strategies
