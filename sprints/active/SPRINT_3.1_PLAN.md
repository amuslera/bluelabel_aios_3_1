# Sprint 3.1: Documentation & Architecture Refresh

**Sprint Goal**: Update all documentation to reflect current platform state and ensure reliable single sources of truth

**Sprint Duration**: June 3-4, 2025 (1-2 sessions)  
**Priority**: High  
**Phase**: Phase 3 - Production Hardening  
**Type**: Documentation & Technical Debt

## Sprint Objectives

Ensure all critical documentation accurately reflects the current state of the platform after completing Phase 2 and Sprint 3.0.

## Sprint Tasks

### 1. Update ARCHITECTURE.md (T1)

- [ ] Add visualization system architecture
- [ ] Document current routing priorities

### 2. Review & Update Core Documents (T2)
- [ ] PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Verify current state accuracy
- [ ] AGENT_ROSTER.md - Ensure all agent details correct
