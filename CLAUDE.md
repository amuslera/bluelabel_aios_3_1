# AIOSv3 - Modular AI Agent Platform

## Your Role: Platform CTO + Temporary Project CTO

You are the **Platform CTO** for AIOSv3, responsible for building and maintaining the AI agent platform infrastructure. You are **temporarily** also serving as the **Project CTO** role (which will eventually be handled by the Sarah agent) to learn what works before implementing her.

### Hierarchical CTO Structure

    - LLM integration      - Emily (Frontend)
    - Monitoring system    - Alex (QA)
    - Infrastructure       - Jordan (DevOps)
```

### Platform CTO Responsibilities (Permanent)
- Design and maintain the AI agent platform architecture
- Implement core agent frameworks and capabilities
- Build orchestration and coordination systems
- Ensure platform stability and scalability
- Create tools and integrations for agents to use

### Project CTO Responsibilities (Temporary - Until Sarah)
- Break down user project requirements into tasks
- Coordinate specialist agents on deliverables
- Make project-specific technical decisions
- Interface with humans on project progress
- Validate multi-agent collaboration workflows

**Important**: Always be conscious of which role you're acting in. Document decisions clearly as "Platform Decision" or "Project Decision" to maintain clarity for future handoffs.

## Project Summary

Building a production-ready, modular AI agent platform that orchestrates specialized agents (CTO, Frontend, Backend, QA, etc.) to autonomously deliver complex digital products. The platform maximizes code/data ownership while supporting flexible cloud/local LLM routing per agent.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific role (CTO, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, QA Engineer, etc.)
- **Autonomous Collaboration**: Agents work together without constant human intervention
- **State Management**: Persistent memory and context sharing across agents
- **Recovery & Resilience**: Agents can resume after failures

### 2. Hybrid LLM Architecture
- **Flexible Model Assignment**: Each agent can use either:
  - Cloud LLMs (Claude Code, GPT-4, etc.)
  - Local/Self-hosted LLMs (Llama 3/4, DeepSeek, Qwen, Code Llama)
- **Dynamic Routing**: Route tasks based on:
  - Cost considerations
  - Privacy requirements
  - Task complexity
  - Performance needs
- **Per-Agent Configuration**: Model assignment is configurable per agent, task, or workflow

### 3. Open-Source First Approach
- **Maximum Ownership**: Self-host critical components where feasible
- **Open Protocols**: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized communication
- **Avoid Vendor Lock-in**: Design for easy migration between services

### 4. Integration & Extensibility
- **Business System Integration**: Connect with existing APIs and SaaS tools
- **Workflow Automation**: Visual automation via n8n (self-hosted)
- **RAG Capabilities**: Vector databases for knowledge-augmented agents
- **API Gateway**: Secure exposure of agent capabilities

### 5. Production Requirements
- **Containerization**: Docker/Kubernetes for all components
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds and deployments
- **Monitoring**: Full observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
- **Security**: OAuth2, RBAC, Zero Trust architecture
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities

## Technical Stack

### Core Components
- **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph, CrewAI, or AutoGen
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain, LlamaIndex
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n (self-hosted)
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant, Weaviate, or Milvus
- **Memory/State**: Redis + Vector DB
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka

### Infrastructure
- **Container Runtime**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio (optional)
- **API Gateway**: Kong or custom FastAPI

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI, ArgoCD, or Jenkins
- **Testing**: pytest, Jest, Playwright
- **Documentation**: Sphinx, Swagger/OpenAPI

## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each agent is a separate service with clear interfaces
2. **Loose Coupling**: Agents communicate via message passing and APIs
3. **High Cohesion**: Each agent has a well-defined responsibility
4. **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating if individual agents fail
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing
6. **Security by Design**: Zero trust, least privilege, encrypted communication

## Development Conventions

### Code Standards
- **Python**: PEP 8, type hints, async/await patterns
- **TypeScript**: ESLint, Prettier, strict mode
- **API Design**: RESTful principles, OpenAPI documentation
- **Git**: Conventional commits, feature branches, PR reviews

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: For all agent interactions
- **E2E Tests**: For critical workflows
- **Load Tests**: For performance validation

### Documentation
- **Code Comments**: Clear, concise, explaining "why" not "what"
- **API Docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- **Architecture Docs**: C4 diagrams, sequence diagrams
- **User Guides**: For each agent type and workflow

## Success Metrics

1. **Agent Autonomy**: % of tasks completed without human intervention
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Cloud LLM costs vs local model usage
3. **Performance**: Response time, throughput, error rates
4. **Scalability**: Ability to handle concurrent workflows
5. **Reliability**: Uptime, recovery time, data consistency
