- [ ] Clear TodoWrite list to indicate sprint completion

**Repository Cleanup & Sync Checklist:**
- [ ] Commit all sprint work with conventional commit messages
- [ ] Push all local changes to remote repository
- [ ] **Branch Management:**
  - [ ] List all branches (`git branch -a`) and identify orphaned branches
  - [ ] Decide on merge vs delete for each orphaned branch (ask if unsure)
  - [ ] Delete merged feature branches locally (`git branch -d branch_name`)
  - [ ] Delete remote tracking branches (`git push origin --delete branch_name`)
  - [ ] Clean up remote tracking references (`git remote prune origin`)
- [ ] **File Organization & Cleanup:**
  - [ ] Archive historical/reference .md files to `/archive/` folder
  - [ ] Remove temporary demo files and test artifacts no longer needed
  - [ ] Delete duplicate or outdated files (check dates and relevance)
  - [ ] Organize documentation files into proper directories
  - [ ] Clean up root directory clutter (move files to appropriate subdirectories)
  - [ ] Review and clean `/demos/`, `/tests/`, `/docs/` directories
- [ ] **Repository Hygiene:**
  - [ ] Verify `.gitignore` is properly excluding build artifacts and temp files
  - [ ] Remove any committed files that should be in `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Run `git gc` to clean up repository database and optimize storage
  - [ ] Validate final repository structure follows project standards
- [ ] **Remote Synchronization:**
  - [ ] Pull latest changes from remote to ensure sync (`git pull origin main`)
  - [ ] Push all local commits to remote (`git push origin main`)
  - [ ] Verify remote repository reflects current state
  - [ ] Clean up any remote artifacts or outdated releases if applicable

**Quality Assurance Checklist:**
- [ ] Run linting and formatting tools (`ruff`, `mypy`, etc.)
- [ ] Execute complete test suite and verify 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Validate all documentation links and references
- [ ] Check that all agent files have proper imports and dependencies
- [ ] Verify configuration files are up to date
- [ ] Test agent initialization and basic functionality

**Outputs:**
- Sprint demo
- Retrospective report  
- Updated knowledge base
- Clean, synchronized repository
- Comprehensive handoff documentation
- Archived sprint data with proper organization
