## 🔧 How to Continue Working

### 1. Understand the System

**Start by reading these key files in order**:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Project instructions and your role
2. **`README.md`** - Updated project overview with current status
3. **`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`** - Understand the 1-minute setup
4. **`docs/CONTROL_CENTER.md`** - Learn the monitoring dashboard
5. **`projects/monitoring/src/enhanced_monitoring_server.py`** - Core server
6. **`src/agents/base/monitoring_agent.py`** - Agent framework

### 2. Validate Current State

**Run these commands to verify everything works**:

```bash
# 1. Check git status (should be clean with recent commits)
git status
git log --oneline -5

# 2. Test the coordination system
python run_coordination_tests.py

# 3. Start the monitoring server (Terminal 1)
python projects/monitoring/src/enhanced_monitoring_server.py

# 4. Start Control Center (Terminal 2) 
python projects/control_center/src/enhanced_control_center.py

# 5. Run example agent (Terminal 3)
export MONITORING_API_KEY="aios_key_from_step_3"
python examples/auto_registering_agent.py
```

**Expected results**:
- Git: Clean working tree, recent commits visible
- Tests: Should pass with high success rate
- Monitoring server: Should start on port 6795 with API key
- Control Center: Should connect and show live dashboard
- Example agent: Should register and appear in dashboard

### 3. Key Working Principles

**Always follow these patterns from the previous session**:

1. **Use TodoWrite tool frequently** - Track all tasks and progress
2. **Read files before editing** - Use Read tool to understand context
3. **Test everything** - Run coordination tests after changes
4. **Commit regularly** - Use descriptive commit messages with 🤖 footer
5. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync with code changes

### 4. Understanding the Architecture

**System Flow**:
```
Agent Registration → Monitoring Server → Control Center Dashboard
     ↓                      ↓                      ↓
Auto-heartbeats → Database Storage → Real-time Updates
```

**Key Components**:
- **Monitoring Server**: Central coordination hub (port 6795)
- **Agent Registry**: Auto-discovery and lifecycle management
- **Control Center**: Real-time dashboard with WebSocket
- **MonitoringAgent**: Base class for auto-registering agents

## 🚨 Critical Information

### Current Git State
- **Branch**: main
- **Commits ahead**: 8 commits ready to push

## 📞 Questions for the User

When you start, consider asking:
1. "Should we continue with specialized agent implementation?"
2. "Would you like to deploy the current system to production?"
3. "Are there any specific features or integrations you'd like to prioritize?"
4. "Should we focus on LLM model integration next?"

**The foundation is complete. The future is ours to build! 🎉**
